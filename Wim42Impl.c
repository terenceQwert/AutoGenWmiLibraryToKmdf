Routine Description:

    This routine is a callback into the driver to retrieve the list of

    routine may not pend or block. Driver should NOT call
    WmiCompleteRequest.

Arguments:

    DeviceObject is the device whose registration info is being queried

    *RegFlags returns with a set of flags that describe the guids being
        registered for this device. If the device wants enable and disable
        collection callbacks before receiving queries for the registered
        guids then it should return the WMIREG_FLAG_EXPENSIVE flag. Also the
        returned flags may specify WMIREG_FLAG_INSTANCE_PDO in which case
        the instance name is determined from the PDO associated with the
        device object. Note that the PDO must have an associated devnode. If
        WMIREG_FLAG_INSTANCE_PDO is not set then Name must return a unique
        name for the device.

    InstanceName returns with the instance name for the guids if
        WMIREG_FLAG_INSTANCE_PDO is not set in the returned *RegFlags. The
        caller will call ExFreePool with the buffer returned.

    *RegistryPath returns with the registry path of the driver. The caller
         does NOT free this buffer.

    *MofResourceName returns with the name of the MOF resource attached to
        the binary file. If the driver does not have a mof resource attached
        then this can be returned as NULL. The caller does NOT free this
        buffer.

    *Pdo returns with the device object for the PDO associated with this

Routine Description:

    This routine is a callback into the driver to query for the contents of

    the callback it should call WmiCompleteRequest to complete the irp before
    returning to the caller. Or the driver can return STATUS_PENDING if the
    irp cannot be completed immediately and must then call WmiCompleteRequest
    once the query is satisfied.

Arguments:

    DeviceObject is the device whose data block is being queried

    Irp is the Irp that makes this request

    GuidIndex is the index into the list of guids provided when the
        device registered

    InstanceCount is the number of instnaces expected to be returned for
        the data block.

    InstanceLengthArray is a pointer to an array of ULONG that returns the
        lengths of each instance of the data block. If this is NULL then
        there was not enough space in the output buffer to fufill the request
        so the irp should be completed with the buffer needed.

    BufferAvail on entry has the maximum size available to write the data
